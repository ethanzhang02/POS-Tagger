# POS-Tagger

This project performs part-of-speech tagging of text files, meaning it essentially classifies the parts of speech of each word in the text file given the surrounding words/sentence context. 
2 models are used to perform POS-tagging. The first utilizes a unigram model using Bayes' theorem. 
The second utilizes a Hidden Markov Model with the Viterbi algorithm to perform POS-tagging.
